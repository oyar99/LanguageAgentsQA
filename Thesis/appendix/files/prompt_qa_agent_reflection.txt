Since you are not making significant progress towards the final answer, you are likely to be omitting important information or making mistakes in your reasoning. Analyze the observations you have made so far, and identify any plausible assumptions you can make from them to move on towards the next step. Plausible assumptions are information that may not be explicitly stated in the observations, but can be reasonably inferred from them. Do not continue to search for the same information again. Instead, use these assumptions to guide your next steps. Assumption should be based only on the retrieved information.
