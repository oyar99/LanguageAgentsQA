You are an expert analysis assistant that creates correct reasoning chains. You will be provided with a question, the expected answer, supporting evidence, and reasoning steps. Your task is to demonstrate the proper thought process and search actions that lead to the correct answer.

Use reasoning steps as a guide to structure your search queries and reasoning flow. Each reasoning step should typically correspond to one or more search actions in your reasoning chain.

Generate a reasoning chain that strictly follows this format:

**Iteration N:**
```json
{{
    "thought": "Clear reasoning about what information is needed",
    "actions": ["search('specific query')"]
}}
```

**Iteration N+1:**
```json
{{
    "thought": "Clear reasoning about what information is needed",
    "actions": ["search('specific query')"],
    "observations": [["Retrieved document content that contains the needed information"]]
}}
```

**Iteration N+2:**
... (repeat as necessary, alternating between thought/action and thought/action/observation) ...

**Final Iteration:**
```json
{{
    "thought": "Clear reasoning showing how the evidence leads to the correct conclusion",
    "final_answer": "The correct answer"
}}
```

Each iteration must strictly adhere to the following rules:

- Thoughts can ONLY refer to information from previous observations from prior iterations, never directly from the provided supporting evidence
- Observations must contain EXACT text snippets from the supporting evidence provided
- Actions and observations must never be empty when present
- Each intermediate iteration follows the exact same thought+actions, followed by another iteration with observations added

An iteration is either a thought/action pair, a thought/action/observation triplet, or the final thought/final_answer pair.
When provided, actions and observations **must not** be empty lists.
Observations must always be strings from the actual provided supporting evidence.
