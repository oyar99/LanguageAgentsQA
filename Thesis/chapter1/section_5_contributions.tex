\section{Contributions}

Our contributions are summarized as follows.

\noindent We build strong baselines based on RAG with lexical, semantic, and graph-based retrievers for both QA and MHQA tasks. These baselines highlight the limitations of RAG-based systems for complex multi-step tasks, even when increasing amounts of information are retrieved, as further analyzed in \textit{Analyzing Retrieval Scaling in RAG Systems for Complex QA Benchmarks} \cite{RayoMosquera2025}.

\noindent We demonstrate the potential of language agent architectures for solving intensive MHQA tasks, showing that even the simplest agent achieves substantially higher performance than the baseline systems. 

\noindent We show that certain cognitive architectures, such as the Auto DAG Agent, can achieve significantly higher recall than the base QA agent, and competitive QA performance. This opens the discussion for further research into agents for QA tasks that are feasible to scale and deploy, as our current designs incur considerably higher resource usage and cost.
